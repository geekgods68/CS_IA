The student announcements page was showing date, time, and priority correctly, but the actual announcement text (content) was not displaying. Instead, it was showing the created_on timestamp.

The issue was in the template `templates/student/student_announcements.html`. The template was using incorrect array indices to access the announcement data from the database query.

The SQL query in `routes/student.py` returns data in this order:
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.title, a.content, a.priority, a.created_on,
       u.username as teacher_name, s.name as subject_name
```

Which maps to these indices:
- `announcement[0]` = `a.id`
- `announcement[1]` = `a.title` 
- `announcement[2]` = `a.content` ‚Üê The announcement text
- `announcement[3]` = `a.priority`
- `announcement[4]` = `a.created_on`
- `announcement[5]` = `u.username as teacher_name`
- `announcement[6]` = `s.name as subject_name`

## What Was Wrong
The template was using:
- `announcement[4]` for content (which is actually the timestamp)
- `announcement[3]` for title (which is actually the priority)
- `announcement[7]` for teacher (which doesn't exist)
- `announcement[5]` for priority (which is actually the teacher name)
- And other incorrect indices

## What Was Fixed
Updated the template to use the correct indices:
- `announcement[2]` for content (the actual announcement text)
- `announcement[1]` for title
- `announcement[5]` for teacher name
- `announcement[3]` for priority
- `announcement[4]` for created_on timestamp
- `announcement[6]` for subject name

## Verification
Created test scripts that confirm:
1. The database contains proper announcement content
2. The SQL query fetches the data correctly
3. The template will now display the actual announcement text instead of timestamps

## Result
Student announcements page now displays the actual announcement content
All other fields (title, teacher, date, priority, subject) display correctly
Priority-based color coding works properly
All existing announcements in the database are properly displayed
