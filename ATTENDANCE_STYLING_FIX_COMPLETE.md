# ATTENDANCE PAGE STYLING FIX - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Layout Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Complex gradients and fancy styling didn't match the rest of the app
- **Solution**: Simplified to use only plain blue (#007bff) and white backgrounds

### 2. Text Overlap and Visibility Issues
- **Problem**: Text was getting overlapped and hidden due to complex layouts
- **Solution**: Simplified HTML structure and removed complex positioning

### 3. Color Scheme Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Multiple colors and gradients throughout the page
- **Solution**: Standardized to use only:
  - **Primary Blue**: #007bff (Bootstrap blue)
  - **White**: #ffffff for backgrounds
  - **Standard Bootstrap colors** for badges (success green, danger red, etc.)
