# Frontend Terminology Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the frontend terminology from "Class Name" to "Session Name" in the class creation interface as requested.

## Changes Made

### Template Updates
**File**: `templates/admin/create_class.html`

#### Before:
- Page Header: "Create Class"
- Form Label: "Class Name"

#### After:
- Page Header: "Create Session"
- Form Label: "Session Name"

### Technical Details
- **Backend routes**: No changes required - the backend still processes the `name` field correctly
- **Database**: No changes required - the database structure remains the same
- **Form functionality**: Fully preserved - form submission works exactly as before
- **Input field**: Still uses `name="name"` attribute for proper form processing

### User Experience Impact
- **Improved clarity**: "Session Name" better reflects what users are creating
- **Consistent terminology**: Aligns with the educational context where sessions are specific learning periods
- **No functional changes**: All existing functionality remains intact

### Verification
✅ Template syntax is valid  
✅ Form maintains proper structure  
✅ Backend processing unchanged  
✅ Database operations unaffected  

## Current State
Users now see:
- **Page Title**: "Create Session" 
- **Input Label**: "Session Name"
- **Functionality**: Identical to previous "class" creation

This change provides better semantic clarity while maintaining all existing functionality. The backend continues to use the `classes` table and related code, but the user interface now presents this as "Sessions" which is more appropriate for an educational platform.

## Notes
- Only the user-facing labels were changed
- Backend code, database schema, and API endpoints remain unchanged
- This ensures backward compatibility while improving user experience
- The change is purely cosmetic/semantic and doesn't affect system functionality
